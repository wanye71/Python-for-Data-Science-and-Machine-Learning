### Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries
```python
# Sup, fam! We're about to spice up our cosmic data exploration with some visualizations:

# First up, we're importing the matplotlib library, our trusty tool for creating cosmic visualizations.
# It's like having a telescope to peer into the depths of our data universe and unveil its secrets.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Next, we're summoning the seaborn library, a powerful ally for creating stunning visualizations with ease.
# Seaborn adds an extra layer of style and flair to our cosmic charts, making them out of this world!
import seaborn as sns

# And last but not least, we're cherry-picking the DataFrame class from the pandas library.
# This class is like our essential tool for organizing and structuring our data for visualization.
from pandas import DataFrame

# Ayo, fam! We're about to create a cosmic DataFrame to explore the characteristics of cosmic beings:

# We're defining a dictionary 'data' containing information about cosmic beings:
# - 'names': Names of cosmic beings
# - 'age': Ages of cosmic beings
# - 'gender': Genders of cosmic beings
# - 'rank': Ranks of cosmic beings (maybe in a cosmic hierarchy)

data = {'names': ['steve', 'john', 'richard', 'sarah', 'randy', 'micheal', 'julie'],
        'age': [20, 22, 20, 21, 24, 23, 22],
        'gender': ['Male', 'Male', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Male', 'Female'],
        'rank': [2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 7, 6]}

# Next, we're using the DataFrame constructor to create a cosmic DataFrame 'df' from the 'data' dictionary.
# This DataFrame organizes the cosmic data into a structured format for exploration and analysis.
# It's like assembling a cosmic council of beings, each with their own characteristics and roles.
df = DataFrame(data)

# Get ready to explore the cosmic council and uncover the mysteries of cosmic beings!
df

### Matplotlib's Bar Chart
# Hey, fam! We're about to create a cosmic bar chart to compare the ages of cosmic beings:

# We're using the plt.bar() function to create a bar chart.
# This chart compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each bar representing a different being.
# It's like lining up the cosmic beings in a cosmic bar, with the height of each bar indicating their age.

plt.bar(df['names'], df['age'])

# Now, we're adding labels to the x-axis and y-axis to provide context to our cosmic bar chart.
# The x-axis label indicates the variable being compared (names of cosmic beings), while the y-axis label indicates the age.
plt.xlabel('Names')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Age')    # Label for the y-axis

# Next up, we're adding a title to our cosmic bar chart to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the chart, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plt.title('Compare Ages')  # Title of the chart

# Finally, we're using plt.show() to display our cosmic bar chart in all its glory!
plt.show()

### Seaborn's Bar Chart
# What up, fam! Get ready for some cosmic data visualization with seaborn:

# We're using the sns.barplot() function from the seaborn library to create a bar plot.
# This plot compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each bar representing a different being.
# It's like stacking up cosmic bars to showcase the ages of different beings.

plot = sns.barplot(data=df, x='names', y='age')

# Next, we're setting a title for our cosmic bar plot to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the plot, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plot.set_title("Comparing Ages")

# And there you have it! Our cosmic bar plot is ready to be unveiled and explored.
# Get ready to dive into the cosmic ages of beings!
plot;

### Line Plot Matplotlib
# Yo, fam! We're about to create a cosmic line plot to compare the ages of cosmic beings:

# We're using the plt.plot() function to create a line plot.
# This plot compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each point representing a different being.
# It's like connecting the cosmic dots to visualize the ages of different beings over a continuum.

plt.plot(df['names'], df['age'])

# Now, we're adding labels to the x-axis and y-axis to provide context to our cosmic line plot.
# The x-axis label indicates the variable being compared (names of cosmic beings), while the y-axis label indicates the age.
plt.xlabel('Names')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Age')    # Label for the y-axis

# Next up, we're adding a title to our cosmic line plot to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the plot, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plt.title('Compare Ages')  # Title of the plot

# Finally, we're using plt.show() to display our cosmic line plot in all its glory!
plt.show()

### Line Plot Seaborn
# Hey, fam! Get ready for some cosmic data visualization with seaborn:

# We're using the sns.lineplot() function from the seaborn library to create a line plot.
# This plot compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each point representing a different being.
# It's like connecting the cosmic dots to visualize the ages of different beings over a continuum.

plot = sns.lineplot(data=df, x='names', y='age')

# Next, we're setting a title for our cosmic line plot to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the plot, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plot.set_title('Compare Ages')

# And there you have it! Our cosmic line plot is ready to be unveiled and explored.
# Get ready to dive into the cosmic ages of beings!
plt.show()

### Pie Chart Matplotlib
# Brace yourselves, cosmic explorers! We're about to dive into the depths of data with a cosmic pie chart:

# Let's kick things off with the plt.pie() function, slicing and dicing the cosmic age pie into segments.
# Each slice represents a cosmic being, giving us a visual feast of age proportions.

plt.pie(df['age'], labels=df['names'])

# Now, let's add a touch of cosmic flair with a title that sets the stage for our cosmic journey.
# "Age Comparison" serves as our guiding star, illuminating the purpose of our cosmic chart.

plt.title('Age Comparison')  # Title of the chart

# And voil√†! Our cosmic pie chart is ready to take center stage, captivating the minds of cosmic wanderers.
# Prepare to embark on a visual odyssey through the age proportions of cosmic beings!
plt.show()

### Pie Chart Seaborn
# Hold onto your space helmets, fam! We're about to add a splash of color to our cosmic pie chart:

# First, we're grabbing a palette of pastel colors using the sns.color_palette() function.
# These colors will breathe life into our cosmic pie chart, making each slice pop with vibrancy.

colors = sns.color_palette("pastel")[0:50]

# Now, armed with our cosmic color palette, we're ready to create our pie chart using plt.pie().
# Each slice will be adorned with a unique pastel hue, adding a visual treat to our cosmic exploration.

plt.pie(df['age'], labels=df['names'], colors=colors)

# And there you have it! Our cosmic pie chart is now a kaleidoscope of colors, ready to mesmerize and delight.
# Get ready to feast your eyes on the cosmic spectrum of age proportions among beings!
plt.show()
