### Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries
```python
# Sup, fam! We're about to spice up our cosmic data exploration with some visualizations:

# First up, we're importing the matplotlib library, our trusty tool for creating cosmic visualizations.
# It's like having a telescope to peer into the depths of our data universe and unveil its secrets.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Next, we're summoning the seaborn library, a powerful ally for creating stunning visualizations with ease.
# Seaborn adds an extra layer of style and flair to our cosmic charts, making them out of this world!
import seaborn as sns

# And last but not least, we're cherry-picking the DataFrame class from the pandas library.
# This class is like our essential tool for organizing and structuring our data for visualization.
from pandas import DataFrame

# Ayo, fam! We're about to create a cosmic DataFrame to explore the characteristics of cosmic beings:

# We're defining a dictionary 'data' containing information about cosmic beings:
# - 'names': Names of cosmic beings
# - 'age': Ages of cosmic beings
# - 'gender': Genders of cosmic beings
# - 'rank': Ranks of cosmic beings (maybe in a cosmic hierarchy)

data = {'names': ['steve', 'john', 'richard', 'sarah', 'randy', 'micheal', 'julie'],
        'age': [20, 22, 20, 21, 24, 23, 22],
        'gender': ['Male', 'Male', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Male', 'Female'],
        'rank': [2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 7, 6]}

# Next, we're using the DataFrame constructor to create a cosmic DataFrame 'df' from the 'data' dictionary.
# This DataFrame organizes the cosmic data into a structured format for exploration and analysis.
# It's like assembling a cosmic council of beings, each with their own characteristics and roles.
df = DataFrame(data)

# Get ready to explore the cosmic council and uncover the mysteries of cosmic beings!
df

### Matplotlib's Bar Chart
# Hey, fam! We're about to create a cosmic bar chart to compare the ages of cosmic beings:

# We're using the plt.bar() function to create a bar chart.
# This chart compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each bar representing a different being.
# It's like lining up the cosmic beings in a cosmic bar, with the height of each bar indicating their age.

plt.bar(df['names'], df['age'])

# Now, we're adding labels to the x-axis and y-axis to provide context to our cosmic bar chart.
# The x-axis label indicates the variable being compared (names of cosmic beings), while the y-axis label indicates the age.
plt.xlabel('Names')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Age')    # Label for the y-axis

# Next up, we're adding a title to our cosmic bar chart to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the chart, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plt.title('Compare Ages')  # Title of the chart

# Finally, we're using plt.show() to display our cosmic bar chart in all its glory!
plt.show()

### Seaborn's Bar Chart
# What up, fam! Get ready for some cosmic data visualization with seaborn:

# We're using the sns.barplot() function from the seaborn library to create a bar plot.
# This plot compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each bar representing a different being.
# It's like stacking up cosmic bars to showcase the ages of different beings.

plot = sns.barplot(data=df, x='names', y='age')

# Next, we're setting a title for our cosmic bar plot to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the plot, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plot.set_title("Comparing Ages")

# And there you have it! Our cosmic bar plot is ready to be unveiled and explored.
# Get ready to dive into the cosmic ages of beings!
plot;

### Line Plot Matplotlib
# Yo, fam! We're about to create a cosmic line plot to compare the ages of cosmic beings:

# We're using the plt.plot() function to create a line plot.
# This plot compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each point representing a different being.
# It's like connecting the cosmic dots to visualize the ages of different beings over a continuum.

plt.plot(df['names'], df['age'])

# Now, we're adding labels to the x-axis and y-axis to provide context to our cosmic line plot.
# The x-axis label indicates the variable being compared (names of cosmic beings), while the y-axis label indicates the age.
plt.xlabel('Names')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Age')    # Label for the y-axis

# Next up, we're adding a title to our cosmic line plot to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the plot, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plt.title('Compare Ages')  # Title of the plot

# Finally, we're using plt.show() to display our cosmic line plot in all its glory!
plt.show()

### Line Plot Seaborn
# Hey, fam! Get ready for some cosmic data visualization with seaborn:

# We're using the sns.lineplot() function from the seaborn library to create a line plot.
# This plot compares the ages of cosmic beings, with each point representing a different being.
# It's like connecting the cosmic dots to visualize the ages of different beings over a continuum.

plot = sns.lineplot(data=df, x='names', y='age')

# Next, we're setting a title for our cosmic line plot to give it a meaningful context.
# The title highlights the purpose of the plot, which is to compare the ages of cosmic beings.
plot.set_title('Compare Ages')

# And there you have it! Our cosmic line plot is ready to be unveiled and explored.
# Get ready to dive into the cosmic ages of beings!
plt.show()

### Pie Chart Matplotlib
# Brace yourselves, cosmic explorers! We're about to dive into the depths of data with a cosmic pie chart:

# Let's kick things off with the plt.pie() function, slicing and dicing the cosmic age pie into segments.
# Each slice represents a cosmic being, giving us a visual feast of age proportions.

plt.pie(df['age'], labels=df['names'])

# Now, let's add a touch of cosmic flair with a title that sets the stage for our cosmic journey.
# "Age Comparison" serves as our guiding star, illuminating the purpose of our cosmic chart.

plt.title('Age Comparison')  # Title of the chart

# And voil√†! Our cosmic pie chart is ready to take center stage, captivating the minds of cosmic wanderers.
# Prepare to embark on a visual odyssey through the age proportions of cosmic beings!
plt.show()

### Pie Chart Seaborn
# Hold onto your space helmets, fam! We're about to add a splash of color to our cosmic pie chart:

# First, we're grabbing a palette of pastel colors using the sns.color_palette() function.
# These colors will breathe life into our cosmic pie chart, making each slice pop with vibrancy.

colors = sns.color_palette("pastel")[0:50]

# Now, armed with our cosmic color palette, we're ready to create our pie chart using plt.pie().
# Each slice will be adorned with a unique pastel hue, adding a visual treat to our cosmic exploration.

plt.pie(df['age'], labels=df['names'], colors=colors)

# And there you have it! Our cosmic pie chart is now a kaleidoscope of colors, ready to mesmerize and delight.
# Get ready to feast your eyes on the cosmic spectrum of age proportions among beings!

import numpy as np

# Next, we're importing the randn function from numpy.random.
# This function generates random numbers from a standard normal distribution.
# Think of this as fueling up our dataset with some randomness for added excitement.

from numpy.random import randn

# Now, let's invite pandas to the party and light up the dashboard with data management capabilities.
# With pandas, we'll cruise through datasets like seasoned drivers, effortlessly handling rows, columns, and indices.
import pandas as pd

# Next, we're importing Series and DataFrame from pandas.
# These data structures will be our trusty companions on the data exploration journey, helping us organize and analyze our data.
from pandas import Series, DataFrame

# Now, it's time to bring in matplotlib.pyplot to visualize our insights.
# This versatile toolkit will transform our data into stunning charts and graphs, painting a vivid picture of our analyses.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Last but not least, we're gearing up with rcParams from matplotlib to customize the look and feel of our visualizations.
# With rcParams, we'll fine-tune our plots to perfection, ensuring they match our style and preferences.
from matplotlib import rcParams

# Alright, gearheads! With our toolkit fully loaded, it's time to hit the data highways and explore the fast lane of analytics.

%matplotlib inline

# Alright, gearheads! Let's fine-tune the dimensions of our plots to ensure they pack a punch:

# We're customizing the figure size using rcParams.
# This line of code sets the width and height of our plots to 5 inches and 4 inches respectively.
# Think of this as adjusting the canvas size before we start painting our data masterpiece.

rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 5, 4

# With the figure dimensions dialed in, our plots are ready to shine on the data highway.
# Get ready to showcase your insights with style and precision, gearheads!

# Note: You can tweak the width and height values to suit your preferences and display requirements.

### Defining axes, ticks, and grids
# Alright, gearheads! Let's take control of our plot axes and steer our visualization in the right direction:

# We're setting up the data for our plot.
# 'x' represents the x-axis values, while 'y' represents the corresponding y-axis values.
# Think of these as the coordinates that define the path of our data journey.

x = range(1, 10)
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# Now, it's time to create a figure to hold our plot.
# We call plt.figure() to initialize a new figure object.
# This figure will serve as the canvas where we'll visualize our data insights.
fig = plt.figure()

# Next, we're adding axes to our figure using fig.add_axes().
# The [left, bottom, width, height] parameters define the position and size of the axes within the figure.
# Think of this as defining the space where our plot will be displayed.
# Here, we're placing the axes at (0.1, 0.1) coordinates with a width and height of 1 unit each.

ax = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.1, 1, 1])

# With the axes set up, it's time to plot our data.
# We use ax.plot() to create a line plot of 'x' against 'y' within the specified axes.
# Think of this as laying out the path of our data journey on the canvas.

ax.plot(x, y)

# With our plot ready to roll, it's time to hit the road and explore the twists and turns of data visualization.
# Get ready to navigate through the data highway with precision and style, gearheads!

# Note: You can adjust the position and size of the axes to customize the layout of your plot.

# Alright, gearheads! Let's fine-tune the axes of our plot for precision navigation through the data highway:

# We're setting up the data for our plot.
# 'x' represents the x-axis values, while 'y' represents the corresponding y-axis values.

# Next, we're adding axes to our figure using fig.add_axes().
# The [left, bottom, width, height] parameters define the position and size of the axes within the figure.
# Think of this as defining the space where our plot will be displayed.

ax = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.1, 1, 1])

# With the axes set up, let's customize the limits of the x and y axes for a focused view of our data.
# We use ax.set_xlim() and ax.set_ylim() to set the lower and upper bounds for the x and y axes respectively.

ax.set_xlim([1, 9])  # Setting the x-axis limits from 1 to 9
ax.set_ylim([0, 5])  # Setting the y-axis limits from 0 to 5

# Now, let's customize the tick marks on the x and y axes to ensure clear navigation through the plot.
# We use ax.set_xticks() and ax.set_yticks() to specify the locations of the tick marks.

ax.set_xticks([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10])  # Setting tick marks on the x-axis
ax.set_yticks([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])           # Setting tick marks on the y-axis

# Get ready to navigate through the twists and turns of data exploration with precision and style, gearheads!

# Note: You can adjust the axes limits and tick marks to suit your preferences and display requirements.
ax.plot(x,y)

# Alright, gearheads! Let's add some gridlines to our plot to stay on track and navigate the data highway with precision:

# We're setting up the data for our plot.
# 'x' represents the x-axis values, while 'y' represents the corresponding y-axis values.
# Think of these as the coordinates that define the path of our data journey.

x = range(1, 10)
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1]

ax.set_xlim([1, 9])  # Setting the x-axis limits from 1 to 9
ax.set_ylim([0, 5])  # Setting the y-axis limits from 0 to 5

# Now, it's time to add gridlines to our plot for better visualization.
# We use ax.grid() to activate the gridlines on the plot.

ax.grid()

# Finally, let's plot our data and hit the road!
# We use ax.plot() to create a line plot of 'x' against 'y' within the specified axes.
# This command lays out the path of our data journey on the canvas.

ax.plot(x, y)

# With the gridlines in place and our data plotted, it's time to rev up the engine and embark on our data exploration adventure!

### Generating multiple plots in one figure with subplots
fig = plt.figure()
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2)
ax1.plot(x)
ax2.plot(x,y)

# Note: You can customize the appearance of the gridlines using additional parameters in ax.grid() if needed.
# Example:
        # plt.xlabel('X Axis Label')          # Customize X axis label
        # plt.ylabel('Y Axis Label')          # Customize Y axis label
        # plt.title('Customized Plot Title')  # Customize plot title
        # plt.xticks(rotation=45)             # Rotate X axis tick labels for better readability
        # plt.yticks(color='blue')            # Change color of Y axis tick labels

        # plt.show()
```

### Plot Formatting
```python
# Ayo, we're about to kick it off with some data exploration using seaborn. Think of seaborn as the slick, electric ride that's gonna take us on a data adventure like no other.
import seaborn as sb
# Next up, we're bringing in numpy, the powerhouse under the hood of our data vehicle. It's like the electric motor that gives us the horsepower to crunch numbers lightning fast.
import numpy as np
# Pandas is joining the party, and it's our go-to for handling tabular data. Picture it as the supercharged battery pack that keeps our data vehicle juiced up and ready to roll.
import pandas as pd
# Time to bring in matplotlib.pyplot, the graphic interface of our data vehicle. It's like the flashy dashboard that displays our data insights with style and flair.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# We're also importing Series and DataFrame from pandas, essential tools in our data exploration toolkit. Series is like the sleek headlights that illuminate individual data points, while DataFrame is the spacious cabin where all our data can chill together.
from pandas import Series, DataFrame
# Lastly, rcParams from pylab is coming in to customize the look and feel of our data visualizations. It's like adding custom rims and paint jobs to our data vehicle, making sure it stands out on the data highway.
from pylab import rcParams

# First up, we're enabling inline plotting with `%matplotlib inline`. This 
# magic command ensures that any plots we create will be displayed directly 
# within our Jupyter Notebook or other IPython environment.
%matplotlib inline

# Next, we're setting the default figure size for our plots using 
# `rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 5, 4`. This line adjusts the width and height 
# of our plots to be 5 inches by 4 inches, ensuring they're the perfect size 
# for viewing and sharing.
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 5, 4

# Now, we're setting the style of our plots to 'whitegrid' with 
# `sb.set_style('whitegrid')`. This style creates a clean and minimalist 
# background with horizontal gridlines, making our plots easy to read and 
# understand.
sb.set_style('whitegrid')

### Defining plot color
# We're defining the x values using the range function, starting from 1 and 
# ending at 9 (exclusive). This creates a sequence of integers from 1 to 9.
x = range(1, 10)

# Next, we're defining the y values as a list containing numeric values. This 
# list represents the heights of the bars in our bar plot.
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0.5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# Now, we're creating a bar plot using the `plt.bar()` function from 
# matplotlib.pyplot. This function takes the x and y values as input and 
# generates a bar plot with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical 
# axis.
plt.bar(x, y)

# We're defining a list called 'wide' containing the widths of each bar in the 
# bar plot. These widths will determine the size of each bar on the x-axis.
wide = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

# We're also defining a list called 'color' containing a single color string 
# 'salmon'. This will set the color of all bars in the bar plot to salmon.
color = ['salmon']

# Now, we're creating a bar plot using the `plt.bar()` function from 
# matplotlib.pyplot. In addition to the x and y values, we're specifying 
# 'width=wide' to set the widths of the bars, 'color=color' to set the color 
# of the bars to salmon, and 'align='center'' to align the bars with the 
# center of each x-coordinate.
plt.bar(x, y, width=wide, color=color, align='center')

# We're defining a variable called 'address' and assigning it the file path of 
# the CSV file containing the data. This path points to the location of the 
# file on the file system.
address = '/workspaces/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/mtcars.csv'

# We're using the `pd.read_csv()` function from the pandas library to read the 
# data from the CSV file located at the specified address. The data is stored 
# in a DataFrame called 'cars'.
cars = pd.read_csv(address)

# We're renaming the columns of the 'cars' DataFrame using the `columns` 
# attribute. The new column names are specified as a list containing strings.
# These names are assigned to the columns in the order they appear in the list.
cars.columns = ['car_names', 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp', 'drat', 'wt', 'qsec', 
                'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb']

# We're selecting the 'mpg' column from the 'cars' DataFrame using bracket 
# indexing. This creates a Series object containing the miles per gallon (mpg) 
# values for each car in the dataset.
mpg = cars['mpg']

# We're using the `plot()` method on the 'mpg' Series to create a line plot of 
# the mpg values. The x-axis will automatically use the index of the Series, 
# while the y-axis will represent the mpg values.
mpg.plot()

# We're selecting a subset of columns from the 'cars' DataFrame using double 
# square brackets '[[]]'. This syntax allows us to select multiple columns 
# simultaneously. The selected columns are 'cyl', 'mpg', and 'wt'.
df = cars[['cyl', 'mpg', 'wt']]

# We're using the `plot()` method on the DataFrame 'df' to create a line plot. 
# By default, the index of the DataFrame will be used for the x-axis, and each 
# column will be plotted as a separate line on the y-axis.
df.plot()

# We're defining a list called 'color_theme' containing three color strings: 
# 'teal', 'peachpuff', and 'powderblue'. These colors will be used to customize 
# the line colors in the plot.

# We're using the `plt.plot()` function from matplotlib.pyplot to create the 
# first line plot. The 'x' and 'y' lists are passed as arguments, providing 
# the x and y coordinates of the points to be connected by lines.
plt.plot(x, y)

# We're using the `plt.plot()` function again to create the second line plot. 
# This time, the 'x1' and 'y1' lists are passed as arguments to specify the 
# coordinates of the points for the second line plot.
plt.plot(x1, y1)

# We're using the `plt.plot()` function from matplotlib.pyplot to create the 
# first line plot. The 'x' and 'y' lists are passed as arguments, providing 
# the x and y coordinates of the points to be connected by lines. Additionally, 
# we're specifying the 'ls' parameter with the value 'solid' to set the line 
# style to solid and the 'lw' parameter with the value 5 to set the line width 
# to 5.
plt.plot(x, y, ls='solid', lw=5)

# We're using the `plt.plot()` function again to create the second line plot. 
# This time, the 'x1' and 'y1' lists are passed as arguments to specify the 
# coordinates of the points for the second line plot. Additionally, we're 
# specifying the 'ls' parameter with the value '--' to set the line style to 
# dashed and the 'lw' parameter with the value 10 to set the line width to 10.
plt.plot(x1, y1, ls='--', lw=10)

plt.plot(x,y, marker='1', mew=20)

# experience for our audience.
%matplotlib inline

# We're setting the figure size using `rcParams['figure.figsize']` to create a 
# spacious and inviting atmosphere for our visualizations. Just like preparing 
# a cozy setting for a romantic dinner, this ensures our plots have enough room 
# to shine.
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 15, 4



# We're setting the style of the plots using `sns.set_style()`. By choosing the 
# 'darkgrid' style, we're adding a touch of mystery and allure to our visual 
# storytelling. It's like setting the mood with dim lighting and a hint of 
# suspense, keeping our audience captivated throughout the journey.
sns.set_style('darkgrid')

### Labeling plot features
#### The functional method
# Ah, the anticipation of revealing our data's story through 
# the artistry of bar plots!

# We're defining our x-values using the `range()` function, 
# creating a sequence of numbers from 1 to 9. It's like 
# selecting the perfect background music to set the mood for 
# our romantic evening.
x = range(1, 10)

# We're defining our y-values, representing the heights of 
# the bars in our bar plot. Each value corresponds to a 
# romantic gesture, ranging from heartfelt declarations to 
# subtle whispers of affection.
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0.5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# We're creating a bar plot using `plt.bar()`, where each 
# bar represents a unique aspect of our data. It's like 
# arranging a bouquet of flowers, with each bloom 
# symbolizing a different emotion in our romantic journey.
plt.bar(x, y)

# We're adding a label to the x-axis using `plt.xlabel()`, 
# providing context for the values displayed along the 
# horizontal axis. It's like adding a caption to a cherished 
# photograph, helping us remember the special moments 
# captured in our data.
plt.xlabel('The x-axis label')

# We're adding a label to the y-axis using `plt.ylabel()`, 
# conveying the meaning behind the values represented along 
# the vertical axis. It's like expressing the depth of our 
# feelings, ensuring our audience understands the significance 
# of each data point in our romantic narrative.
plt.ylabel('The y-axis label')


z = [1,2,3,4,0.5]
veh_type = ['bicycle', 'motorbike', 'car', 'van', 'stroller']

# We're creating a pie chart using `plt.pie()`, where each slice 
# represents a different vehicle type. It's like exploring a 
# diverse range of transportation options, from bicycles to strollers.
plt.pie(z, labels=veh_type)
plt.show()

### The object-oriented method

# We're reading data from a CSV file containing information about cars.
address = '/workspaces/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/mtcars.csv'
cars = pd.read_csv(address)

# We're renaming the columns of the DataFrame to enhance readability 
# and comprehension. It's like giving each car in our dataset a 
# distinctive name for easier identification.
cars.columns = ['car_names', 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp', 'dratr', 'wt', 'qsec', 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb']

# We're selecting the 'mpg' column from the DataFrame, representing 
# the miles per gallon for each car. It's like focusing on a key 
# aspect of each romantic partner's personality.
mpg = cars.mpg

# We're creating a new figure object for our plot.
fig = plt.figure()

# We're adding an axes object to the figure, specifying its position 
# and dimensions. It's like setting up a canvas for our artistic 
# expression.
ax = fig.add_axes([.1,.1,1,1])

# We're plotting the 'mpg' values on the axes. It's like sketching 
# the outline of our romantic journey, highlighting the fuel efficiency 
# of each car.
mpg.plot()

# We're setting the positions of the x-axis ticks and customizing their 
# labels. It's like marking significant milestones in our journey and 
# attaching meaningful memories to each one.
ax.set_xticks(range(32))

ax.legend(loc='best')

### Annotating your plot

# We're finding the maximum 'mpg' value in the dataset. It's like identifying 
# the peak of our romantic journey, the moment of maximum fuel efficiency.
mpg.max()

# We're creating another figure object for our plot.
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_axes([.1,.1,1,1])

# We're plotting the 'mpg' values on the axes. It's like painting the canvas 
# of our romantic journey with strokes of data points, visualizing the 
# variability in fuel efficiency.
mpg.plot()

# We're setting the positions of the x-axis ticks and customizing their 
# labels. It's like marking significant milestones in our journey and 
# attaching meaningful memories to each one.
ax.set_xticks(range(32))
ax.set_xticklabels(cars['car_names'], rotation=50,fontsize='medium')

# We're setting the title of the plot to describe its content. It's like 
# giving our artwork a title that captures its essence and emotional impact.
ax.set_title('Miles Per Gallon of Cars in mtcars')

# We're adding labels to the x-axis and y-axis to provide context for the 
# data being displayed. It's like adding captions to our artwork to guide 
# the viewer's interpretation.
ax.set_xlabel('car names')
ax.set_ylabel('miles/gal')

# We're setting the y-axis limits to focus on a specific range of values. 
# It's like zooming in on a particular section of our journey to explore 
# it in more detail.
ax.set_ylim([0,45])

# We're annotating a specific data point on the plot, highlighting its 
# significance. It's like adding a note to our artwork, providing additional 
# context for the viewer's understanding.
ax.annotate('Toyota Corolla', xy=(19,33.9), xytext=(21,35), arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05))

# We're adding a legend to the plot to provide additional information about 
# the displayed data. It's like providing a key to help the viewer interpret 
# the visual elements in our artwork.
ax.legend(loc='best')

# We're saving the plot as an image file for future reference or sharing. 
# It's like preserving our artwork in a tangible form, allowing others to 
# experience it even when they're not present.
